# PPIDM-check

## What's it about?

PPIDM-check aims to replicate & validate the findings of the PPIDM method proposed by Alborzi et al. (2021). PPIDM-check does this by conducting another overlap analysis with experimentally resolved DDIs. 
In addition to that, PPIDM-check rewires the PPIDM-computed DDI network to evaluate it's robustness to false information. As a third and last evaluation method, we constructed an extended version of the PPI/DDI 
graph used by NEASE (Louadi et al., 2021) and compared the updated findings with existing literature. 

To then make use of the predictions, we built another extended DDI graph that can be integrated into DIGGER (Louadi et al., 2021).
